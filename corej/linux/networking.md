Open system interconnection model

it tells how data should travel over a network

Please Do Not Throw Sause Pizza Away

Physical Layer is first layer of OSI model. Because no physical layer no network.


1) Application Layer
	Is used by network applicaiton like chrome firefox outlook
   Only layer where user interacts with the data
   SMTP 25 , HTTP, POP3, IMAP, DHCP, DNS, TELNET, FTP
   
   80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS) or 8080 (HTTP Alternate).
   FTP 21, SSH(Secure shell protocol) 22 and TELNET 23  both telnet and ssh is used to connect remote machine but ssh is secure and encrypted
   DHCP Server 67
	DHCP Client 68
	DNS 53
	
	source.vmware.com	source is hostname (name of the machine) vmware.com is domain name
	.com is top level domain, vmware is second level domain 

when you hit browser with fqdn is resolved by dns server then a socket is opened on the client side to communicate(browser tries to resolve the query from its cache then if not found it sends the query to local dns server then to others and then to root servers(top level)

HTTPS stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure. It is highly advanced and secure version of HTTP. It uses the port no. 443 for Data Communication. It allows the secure transactions by encrypting the entire communication with SSL. It is a combination of SSL/TLS protocol and HTTP. It provides encrypted and secure identification of a network server.
	
	HTTP request generally open a connection over network and if the response is recieved it closes that connection same thing happens with rest api
	websocket is a protocol used to create a communication channel over the tcp protocol which will remain open until either client or server terminates the connection
	this is used in the application which require real time data
	like stocks app`gaming app and chat
   
2) Presentation layer
	Translation Encryption and compression 
	SSL
	
3) Session Layer
	Establishing connection, maintaining connection, terminating the connection

4) Transport Layer
	data segmentation , flow control and error control, sequencing
	flow control is when server adjust transmission of data according to the speed of the client
	error control is when server resent the segment which are lost or does not received by the client
	sequencing the segemtn at client side
	TCP and UDP
	TCP does error checking and UDP does not
	Data is called segments in transport layer and it is sent to network layer

5) Network Layer 
	Converts segment into packets
	It descides the best path for the packets
	Routers and L3 Switches
	
	IPV4 IPV6 IPSec and routing protocols OSPF RIP, ICMP  internet control messaging protocol
	
	Packet->  IPSender:IP Receiver: Segment
	
6) Data Link Layer
	COnver packets into frame 
	framing and physical addressing
	Switches , Bridges and NIC
	PPP, PPTP, ARP, RARP( point to point, address resolution protocol , reverse address rp)
	
	Frame:-> MacSender: MacReceiver: Packet
	
7) Physical Layer
	Converts data into bits 
	Hub Repeaters Cables
	Data is called bits here
	
	
	
****IP Address

IPV4 is 32 bit address divided into class A,B, C, D, E
0000000-1111111 each block N.N.N.N is of 8 bit


IP Address   NetworkAddress:HOST Address


Class			Range			Subnet Mast		Default CIDR(Classless inter domain routing)
Class A			0-126			255.0.0.0		8
B			128-191			255.255.0.0		16
C			192-223			255.255.255.0		24
D			224-239				X
E			240-255				X

127.0.0.1 is missing..its a loopback address to check whether nic card is working or not. 
to check type 127.0.0.1

192.168.x.x and 10.x.x.x are typicaly used within private network

First ip address is network id and the last one is broadcast id


***** Network Interface Card
or Network Adapters, Lan Adapters, 

can be wired or wireless

***Hub switch router gateway bridge
Hub connnects devices in the same network ...physical layer...it just broadcast the data to all devices
Swith also does the same thing but it sends to a particulal system using ARP ( address resolution protocol ) unicasting/multicasting
swtichs are also used to create VLAN to configure ie to break the lan into small virtual lans restricting and allowing communication between lan is configurable
hub and switch works at physical layer ...l3 switch works in network layer
router works at network layer connecting networs together

hub and swithc works with frames and router works with packets

bridge works in physical layer, bridge is used in bus topology where all systems are connected via a bridge. it is used to divide lan into different segments, as in bridge the frames are broadcaseted , bridge helps to broadcast only in a particular segement.
broadcasting also causes traffic congestion

Gateway is any device which connects two network together*, *which uses diffent protocol,  like router,switch, firewall server or any device that enable data flow in and ou

, gateway is also called protocol convertor



****Port Number

***** Topologies

Star Bus and Ring



*** NAT
Consider home network where router have a public IP address and connected device have private IP address
router maintains a table which private IP address wants to connect to which public ip address ( any server like google or amazon server)
so the router transalte the router ip address to private ip address

*** VLAN VPN
logical division of ip address is called subnetting or dividing large network into small netowrk 
and logical division of ethernet is called vlan

*****proxies revese proxy
proxy server stands between netowork and the internet
	save bandwidth( by caching the data ex windows update)
	firewall
	network monitoring
	Access control: blocking unwanted websites

******Firewall
secure wall between private and public network
Firewall usese below techniques:
packet filtering: Block public ip address which are not allowed to communicate with the private network
IP hiding: hides the ip address of private network using NAT or proxy server
Port blocking : block the ports of gateway or system which are not allowed to communicate with public network

types of fire wall
hardware and software
hardware firewall protects the entire network and are generally installed on a gateway
software firewall are installed on a machine

access controllist

network topology


*****TPM***********
Truted platform module is a chip on dell gateways used to store the state of the gatewy cryptology
A fingerprint tool generate a json have PCR(Platform configuration Register) values of the BIOS parameters of the gateway for boot time attestation 
A different tools generate ima json (Integrity measure architechture) generate SHA for all the files on the gateways for runtime attestation

these two files goes as the gateways security profile for all the gateways and they are matched
