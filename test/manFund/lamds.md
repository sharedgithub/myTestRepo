#### Three defects 

1) DOS attack TPM memory leak (memory leak can occur in java due to static variable , file connection not closed in finalize()
2) Protocol uploading failing above 10K when user unenrols and enrolls the decice ..it was uploading one less protocol ...due to one parameter update...flaw in programming logic
3) zcs has nodes and loadbalance and it was redirecting the request to first node only. so if it has three nodes the workflow would work only for the first time. This occured when I tried to attempt 
4) bluetoth mobile app was downloading the agent and sending it to the gateways but when we connect mobile app to different cloud app it sends the same agent for downloading

### Quality of leader
Two skills which are most important
Effective Communication skills 
	Communicate clear instructions with the team members 
	Listen to the queries and feedback from the team members
	Efeectively report the status to everyone
	encourage comm
Strong Organisation Skills 
	The team leader must get the task done by the available resources and available time.
	Should be able to manage his work and also make sure team is not getting blocked




###Roles and responsibilities
Being part of the feature estimation meeting with all the stakeholders
feature impact analysis meaning
Release planning breaking down the feature for the team
4 spints 1 hardening sprint
sizing the stories by giving points
deciding according to load capacity and velocity of the team how much we can take in a sprint
sprint planning
3M meating
--Monitoring the progress
--Assignning task to the team member according to their skills and capabilities
--Highlighting any obstacles impediments to our clint and senior management
--Giving feedback and helping team members with their work
--reporting daily progress and impediments
--Root cause analysis/defects triaging of the defects to see why those defects occured
daily scrum
sprint retrospective


###chalenges as a Lead
unplanned leaves/sick leaves : mitigation by reshuffling the work according to the bandwidth and streaching work hours if required
Adhoc/unplanned work: testing of things which were not aggreed upon during planning
Team member with low motivation to work: mitigate by talking to them , see what is that which can keep encouraging them doing the work
			some of them want to do more like automation
			some of them going through a difficult phase of life
			some might be in a project for too long and they want to do something else
			see if they are not able to work due to lack of specific skill or confidence
Meeting other expectations of manager : Like helping other team or doing some other work which managers delegates. sometimes manager delegates their work to others
			
###chanlenges as individual
iot is full of challenge working as Individual contributor is challenge lots of delta you have to go through lots of documentation to understand the underlying functionality and to meet the deadlines at the same time. so many kind of testing required to signoff that functionality so its important to decide what kind of testing is in scope and which all functionality need to be tested


testing of the mobile application
testing the functionality of onboard, if bluetooth is turned off , if the connectivity is lost, if the gateway is not discoverable mode
if the gateway is not registered on applcation, distance between you and the gateway, invalid pairing key, if the device is already onboarded
if there is incoming call or you are making call , software update , applicaton crash, gateway crash, invalid arch type agent to the gateway

dev work taking more time qa were getting less time so i said till thursday will be cutoff
Also doing testing and automation in the same sprint was becoming a challenge so i asked for shadow resources
Each team had there own QA to  begin with but as a lead I was not able to utilize them effectively so i asked the team let QA be a shared pool of resources
Multitasking for QA by having knowledge sharing sessions


##Failure as lead # most challenging project roel

I was given role of a lead very early in my carrier. I had less than two years of experience. I had no idea what leading a team was all about
I was lacking knowledge about how when and what to communicate with my senior management
My manager was not happy about my performance 
I made mistakes like not asking my manager about her expectations from me
I was saying yes to all the things given to me
I was finding it hard to manage both my work and the team together because of that I had to work on weekdays
I was very lenient about the deadlines which i used to give to the team because of which 


confidence in the team
Repect the other team member s
Honest and open to all the team member
encourage communication between team members
grooming/training of the team
Creating a pleasant/inspiring/motivational environment for team members.
Giving opportunities to the team members to learn new skill
Encouraging the members by valuing their suggestions
Supporting the team members to try again if they have made a mistake.
Access the performance of the team members
assignning task to team members depending on their capabilities and bandwidth


## As a manager i would like you to 
provide regular feedback about my performace
Address problems of the employee when needed and not delay them
Give direction to the team
encourage the team members to put there 100%
Give me clear cut responsibilities and be clear with the expectation


#Rude staff
most of the time people have good reasons to be rude so it is important for us to understand those reasons first. Its important to understand what hidden message they want to convey by being rude by talking to them. Once you know that and put enough efforts to understand he underlying reason over the period of time they 
will stop being rude atleast to you.
for ex: 

#challenging part of being a leader
Challenging part of being a leader is doing work assigned to him and looking into the obstacles of all team member, communicating with the other team and after attending all the meeting. WIth all this and being productive at the same time is difficult. Generally only half of the bandwidth is considered for a lead duing the planning but due to variaous reasons like discuussion over a blcker or a fix consumes a lot of time

#To achieve the goals, I take the following actions:-
Keep updating my knowledge in my domain by doing training and certifications
Keep communicating with the team member to build a relationship with them
Ask the support of my seniors and my team members if I need any help in the project
Keep a check on my productivity as well as my team productivity.
Enjoy my work


#Conflict

conflict generally can occur diffenct reasons such as
	Misunderstanding
	difference of opinion

for ex multiple teams were there in the previous project ..genereally a user story will have both the backend and UI development and generally done by a team but sometimes backend user story was developed by different team and UI story by diffent team so during planning genrally such kind of confict occurs which team will do the e2e testing for that story as all the teams were sharing my QA resources so it was my duty to resolve such conficts. Also all the QA resources management goes through me sometimes i have to take difficult decisions such as which person will do what feature testing and with which team . most of the times they want to have the best resouce to be testing their work but as a lead it was my responsibility to decide which are the critical functionality and who should be doing that work


#weekness

I find it very difficult to get up early in the morning or attend any meatings anything after 10 to 7


##strong

My interest in the work I do. I study about new tools and technology in my free time like to understand new technologies and incorporate in my current work to help me provide effective solutions

I am a teamplayer. My focus is always to make sure the whole team is moving forward. Lot of times it happens that someone would be dependent on you for a peice of work and if i find it as a blocker for that persion I would do anything in my capacity to unblock that person first and then do my work

Over the years I have worked in different projects,work envrionment, tools and technologies which has made me highly adaptible to any kind of work given to me. Wether its IC role or a team lead role I think i can adapt

For ex my last transition from windows to linux, from testing clearly written functionalities to an envrionment where everything is unknown was difficult at first but then i got used to that envionment. I found drawing boundries to the testing was really important 


##things I am good at

##accompolished and prooud of## challenges in you previous project 


##handeled stress/pressure  ## dificuutl situation ## challenge
I like to organize my work
keeping a priority list with param importance, urgent, time required
Given a task to test android and ios mobile app as soon as i joined and develop team was in US
	procuring the mobile app , using the xcode on ios building project(test different screen and os version
	android simulator testing the app, running test on real application
	procuring the bluetooth enabled gateway, instaling the right os, right services, configuration to make that os bluetooth enabled
	and finally tesing mobile app and doing diffent kind of tesiting, automation testing
	plan: identifying the devices, mobile and gateway and laptop procuring them immediately
	      identified screens and os using boundry value analysis
	      skipping automation R&D was invloded and framework was not ready for appium
	      starting test immediately with simulators to report bug early
	       later I continued testing on real devices
	       identified what kind of test we will be carrying out and what not

Questions for me
	This requirement is for a project specific or very generic 
	Wether the project is in intial state , how long will it goals
	what does this role stand between the organization hierarchy
	what would be my responsibilities and expectionas from me
	How is it like to work in this company what are its core values?
	why i should work for
